## What is Calypso?
Calypso is a (WIP) mod loader aimed at making it easier than ever for developers to create a quick and simple modding API for their Godot games. Calypso can be easily tailored to fit the developer's needs/desires, including options for speed, binary size optimization, custom path configuration, and several internal options to play with.

## Why?
Modding has become an integral part of the gaming world, allowing players to customize their experience while playing your game to their heart's content. Calypso's goal is to lower the barrier of entry to growing your game's lifespan and more easily fostering a community, simplifying the process for both the developer and end user.

## Quick Start


download Calypso from the [Releases]() tab and place in your `addons` folder.

> üí° Restart Godot after installation to enable Calypso

## Usage
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: As of right now, Calypso is in incredibly early stages. Calypso should NOT be used in any sort of production environment whatsoever.
> 
> Because of this, running Calypso standalone simply outputs an example `*.cy` file (Calypso module).
